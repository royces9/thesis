%
In conclusion, we found that the stochastic specificity and its distribution
for the CB3 and bifan motif are non-trivial functions of \ce{x1}.
%
The CB3 specificity and \spec{x1} and \spec{y2} from the bifan motif, were found to decrease
as functions of \ce{x1}; \spec{x2} and \spec{y1} from the bifan motif increased as functions of
\ce{x1}.
%
In addition, for all specificities, the width of the distribution was found to increase\
with the mean, however, the distribution is not a simple Poisson distribution, with\
$\sigma^2=\mu$, but as a function of \ce{x1}.
%
More over, the specificity does not behave cleanly for the stochastic system,\
so another type of measure of system selectively should be defined for low copy\
numbers.
